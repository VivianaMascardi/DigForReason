# DigForReason


DigForReas-J is a tool implemented by Alessandro Biagetti to fulfill his Master Thesis in Computer Science at the University of Genova, under the guidance of Prof. Viviana Mascardi (University of Genova) and Dr. Angelo Ferrando (University of Liverpool). It provides functionalities to reason on DigForSim's output (see the twin project https://github.com/VivianaMascardi/DigForSim); DigForReas-J is implemented in Java using the SWING library for developing a Graphical User Interface.

The idea of implementing DigForSim and DigForReas-J was born inside the "Digital Forensics: Evidence Analysis via Intelligent Systems and Practices" (DigForASP) COST Action CA17124, https://digforasp.uca.es, funded for four years starting from 10/09/2018 by the European Cooperation in Science and Technology COST, www.cost.eu. The challenge addressed by DigForASP is to reason on evidences on crimes and their perpetrators collected from various electronic devices in order to reconstruct possible events, event sequences and scenarios related to the crime.
